On this page the URPG community is able to log bugs and make requests for new features, or enhancements to existing features. These should be listed under the bug or enhancement label.

The todo label is used by me - issues tagged with this label represent features that are currently being worked on, or I intend to complete before the next release.

If you have questions or need help using the bot, please don't post here. It will be much quicker for you to DM me (Monbrey) or any URPG staff member.

When logging a bug, please include the following information:

The command/bot interaction that was running at the time
The bot's behaviour
The expected behaviour
A link to the message where this occurred (hover over the message, click the three vertical dots and select Copy Link)
When logging new feature or enhancement requests, please include the following information:

If enhancement, the existing feature you're referring to
If new, the name of the would-be-command if applicable
Description of the feature - include any data it would require, or a pseudo-interaction demonstration how the bot would respond
